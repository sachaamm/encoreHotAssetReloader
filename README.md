# encoreHotAssetReloader
A fixture to improve [Webpack-Encore](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore) with hot reload assets files : **css**, **scss** &amp; **js**, for the ease of local development. I made a server in order to work alongside independtly with [Webpack-Encore](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore) by ensuring asset hot reloading. I wanted to host this repository as a contrib recipe. **This recipe is working only with Symfony v4.0 or greater.**
